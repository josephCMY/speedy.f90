speedy.f90 is an intermediate complexity atmospheric general circulation model written in modern Fortran. It is based on [SPEEDY](http://users.ictp.it/~kucharsk/speedy-net.html), developed by Fred Kucharski, Franco Molteni and Martin P. King.


## Disclaimers
This branch is created by Man-Yau (Joseph) Chan for the purpose of injecting noise into the initial conditions.

The original speedy.f90 repository can be found [here](https://github.com/samhatfield/speedy.f90).




## Installation

speedy.f90 has only one dependency: the NetCDF library. To build speedy.f90:

1. Install the [NetCDF library](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf) and locate the install directory. For example, on my system it is stored in `/usr`.
2. Set the `NETCDF` environment variable to point to the directory containing the NetCDF `include` and `lib` directories. For example, for my system I run `export NETCDF=/usr`.
3. Run `build.sh` to build speedy.f90: `bash build.sh`. A binary directory, `bin`, will be created an the speedy.f90 executable `speedy` will be placed in this directory.
4. Run `run.sh` to run speedy.f90: `bash run.sh`. The output will be stored in `rundir`. By default, speedy.f90 will run for two days and output one NetCDF file for each time step.
